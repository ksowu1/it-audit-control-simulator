## 📌 Overview

A *dataset* is a JSON file that defines all inputs for an IT audit scenario:

- Users & access control data  
- Privileged access  
- Change management records  
- Backup & recovery history  
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) rules  

The simulator loads this dataset and executes all audit tests.

Datasets give you complete control over:
- Risk profiles  
- Level of compliance  
- edge-case scenarios  
- Training and demos
